# Algorithms Collection

This solution contains simple implementations of common algorithms and corresponding unit tests.

Projects:
- `Algorithms` - library with algorithm implementations (sorting, searching, graph traversals, misc, collections)
- `Tests` - xUnit tests referencing the `Algorithms` project (using FluentAssertions)

How to run tests:
- Use `dotnet test` in the solution directory.

Examples included:
- Sorting: Bubble sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, Heap sort
- Searching: Linear search, Binary search
- Graphs: BFS, DFS, Topological sort (Kahn), Dijkstra
- Collections/utilities: Balanced parentheses checker
- Misc: Factorial, Fibonacci

These are small, educational implementations and not optimized for production use.
