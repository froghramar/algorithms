# Algorithms Collection

This solution contains simple implementations of common algorithms and corresponding unit tests.

Projects:
- `Algorithms` - library with algorithm implementations (sorting, searching, graph traversals, misc)
- `Tests` - xUnit tests referencing the `Algorithms` project

How to run tests:
- Use `dotnet test` in the solution directory.

Examples included:
- Bubble sort, Quick sort
- Linear search, Binary search
- BFS, DFS (graph traversals)
- Factorial, Fibonacci

These are small, educational implementations and not optimized for production use.
